GetData__PeerAssessment
=======================

Repository for programming assignment in the course 'Getting and Cleaning Data'.
This repository contains an Rscript "run_analysis.R", that creates a tidy dataset
and a MarkDown codebook, "CodeBook.md" which describes the transformations made to the raw data by this script.
The script requires installation of the dplyr package.
The script will download a ZIP file and extract it into a directory ./UCI HAR Dataset. 
The generated tidy data is ultimately exported into a textfile, "tidytext.txt"
